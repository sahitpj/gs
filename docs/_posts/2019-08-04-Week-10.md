In this week, we focused on working to create a baseline for our created model.

## Additional Configuration
The additional confiugurations added to the web applications, now allows users to set a pre-defined configuration for the web-app. This can be modified to override, hearst patterns and DBpedia property lexicalisation.

## Building the baseline
Using a set of configurations we define a baseline for our model. The configurations include the following ones
1. hearst patterns method
2. Parse-tree method
3. Dependencies method. 

The baseline was made by using text snippets from the following [file](https://worksheets.codalab.org/rest/bundles/0xb4ab264671fe4e3bae00e9367a88eaeb/contents/blob/). 

These were then fed into our web-app with the following configurations. A baseline generated from the following can be found [here](https://github.com/sahitpj/GSoC-codebase/blob/master/tests/webApp-baseline-results.txt)

Using this we can improve upon our results

## Improvement to the Dependencies Method. 

The dependencies method, can be improved to capture the subject and object better. These include using them to find the complete entity instead a part of it and also including better hypernym detection. This will be worked on during the current week.
