title: Week - 10 :- Building the baseline

In this week, we focused on working to create a baseline for our created model.

## Additional Configuration
The additional confiugurations added to the web applications, now allows users to set a pre-defined configuration for the web-app. This can be modified to override, hearst patterns and DBpedia property lexicalisation. The configuration for the web application is now stored by the application in a json.

```json
{
   "use_parse_tree":null,
   "use_dependencies":null,
   "dependency_level":null,
   "use_dependencies_with_coref":"",
   "use_existing_hearst":null,
   "addn_hearst_patterns":[
      [
         "NP_(\\w+).*?(broadcast).*?on.*?.*?NP_(\\w+)",
         " first",
         "broadcastOn",
         3
      ],
      [
         "NP_(\\w+).*?(air).*?on.*?.*?NP_(\\w+)",
         " first",
         "airOn",
         3
      ]
   ],
   "hearst_pattern_type":"Default",
   "language":"English",
   "addn":{
      "broadcast_on":" http://dbpedia.org/ontology/frequency",
      "air_on":" http://dbpedia.org/ontology/channel"
   },
   "use_spotlight":null
}
```

This can be changed by setting the configuration in the `config` page. The web application can then be run from the main/demo page of the website. 

## Building the baseline
Using a set of configurations we define a baseline for our model. The configurations include the following ones
1. hearst patterns method
2. Parse-tree method
3. Dependencies method. 

The baseline was made by using text snippets from the following [file](https://worksheets.codalab.org/rest/bundles/0xb4ab264671fe4e3bae00e9367a88eaeb/contents/blob/). 

These were then fed into our web-app with the following configurations. A baseline generated from the following can be found [here](https://github.com/sahitpj/GSoC-codebase/blob/master/tests/webApp-baseline-results.txt). A small snippet of the following results created.

```
A. Spectre
1. (spectre, hypernym, film); (spectre, endIn, SkyFall)
2. (Spectre, produced, James); (Daniel, marking, Daniel); (245 million dollars, madeBy, Bond); (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distributed, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer)
3. (Waltz, hypernym (low), film); (film, hypernym (low), SkyFall); (film, producedBy, Eon Productions); (film, mark_into, series); (film, hypernym, Spectre)
```

Using this we can improve upon our results

## Improvement to the Dependencies Method. 

The dependencies method, can be improved to capture the subject and object better. These include using them to find the complete entity instead a part of it and also including better hypernym detection. This will be worked on during the current week.
