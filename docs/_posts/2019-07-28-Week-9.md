The last week concluded the second evaluation of my GSoC project, which I successfully completed! This week was extending configuration and adding multi-lingual support.

## Extending Configuration
The web-app configuration page now suppports the following - 
- Adding your own hearst patterns (this may be specific to you or your language chosen)
- lexicalisation of dbpedia properties

## Language Supprt
The Web-app now supports three more languages which are
- German
- French
- Spanish

This includes all methods, from hearst patterns to parse-tree and dependencies. This coupled along with spotlight according the language which is to be used can be used to generate triples from the following 5 languages. However default hearst patterns, only are available for English

Language support for spotlight was added by deploying docker images for the respective spotlight languages. 

```
English	docker run -i -p 2222:80 dbpedia/spotlight-english spotlight.sh
French	docker run -i -p 2225:80 dbpedia/spotlight-french spotlight.sh
German	docker run -i -p 2226:80 dbpedia/spotlight-german spotlight.sh
Spanish	docker run -i -p 2231:80 dbpedia/spotlight-spanish spotlight.sh
```
