This week was all about Integrating the methods which we developed into triple extraction to our web-app. 

## Method Integration
The main page of our app provides the demo, where the user can type in the text he wants to get triples from and will also be allowed to choose the methods

The page also the detialed explanation of each method, below along with the relavant blog posts which talk about how those methods work

## Triples
The triples once extracted are displayed on the results page. If the spotlight feature is applied, then the entity identified from the spotlight API is mentioned.

## Deployment
Deployment is still being worked, given heroku throws memory errors with the operations being performed for triple extraction.
