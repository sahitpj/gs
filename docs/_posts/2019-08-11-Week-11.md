In this week the dependencies method was improved on and the RDF generation tool was added. 

## Dependencies Method
Given the results of the baseline test, the dependencies method was improved on in the following week, by better identifying the subjects and objects of the triples. Hypernyms too were checked for validity while processing it. 

Dependencies with coreferences too has been added as a method for the configuration page.

## Configuration page edits
The configuration pages now has two input text boxes. One for adding hearst patterns and the second one for adding dbpedia properties and lexicalizations. These inputs can be used to override the already existent ones. The `about` page was also updated to add context about the hearst patterns, the pre-defined hearst patterns and the DBpedia properties/lexicalizations. 

## RDF text
The web-app now allows you to get the RDF text for the triples being generated. This option can be found at the bottom of the results page only if spotlight is enabled in the configuration
