And that's a wrap for the Google Summer of Code program this year. I had an amazing time and I definitely did learn a lot. From writing my proposal to spending 3 months, writing code for DBpedia, things have come a long way. 

I would like to thank my mentor [Mariano Rico](https://sites.google.com/site/marianorico/welcome) for all the help he has given me throughout the project. Couldn't have done it without him! Things which I did learn through the course of this program regarding software development in general

- Righting clean code
- Documentation for the code as well as an application which you are creating
- Software optimization

Will defnitely continue to contribute to open source and look forward to helping DBpedia if they have any improvement work regarding this project. Regarding whether I would be applying for GSoC for my next summer - givem the chanve I would absolutely do so!
